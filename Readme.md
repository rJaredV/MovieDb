# README

MovieDB is a small project app that I made for an interview Coding Challenge

## Installation
I am assuming that react-native-cli and react-native are already installed.
Clone or download this repository, then open your terminal and cd to the directory.

Your Api key for TMDB should be added to the line:

```js
// Line 1 in './src/net/Network.js'
const APIkey = ''; //TODO: Put your own API KEY HERE

```



```bash
cd movieDb
yarn
react-native run-ios
```

## Features
- Display Trending Movies
- Basic Search functionality for other movies
