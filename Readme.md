MovieDB is a small project app that I made for an interview Coding Challenge

## Installation
I am assuming that react-native-cli and react-native are already installed.
Clone or download this repository, then open your terminal and cd to the directory.
```bash
cd movieDb
yarn
react-native run-ios
```
